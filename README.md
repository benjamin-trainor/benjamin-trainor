# 👋 Hi, I’m Benjamin

### Backend & Systems Engineer | Rust | Go | Haskell | TypeScript | Distributed Systems | Correctness-focused

---

## About Me
I’m a software engineer focused on backend and systems-level engineering. I build long-lived services, event-driven systems, and runtime components from first principles. My passion lies in correctness, concurrency, and understanding how systems work under real-world conditions.
